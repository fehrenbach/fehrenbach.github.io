  <h1 id="purescript-and-google-closure-notes">PureScript and Google Closure notes</h1>
<p>I have played around with PureScript and Google Closure sometime in
the last couple of weeks. The interesting part is of course advanced
compilation. It doesn’t work out of the box and there are some hurdles
to getting it to work even in principle. I’m not going to work on it
in the near future, but I want to write down some observations, just
in case.</p>
<p>The reason I have looked at Closure at all is that I keep thinking of
ways to generated better JavaScript code from PureScript. We could not
emit dictionaries for classes with no methods. We do not need an
object as a dictionary if the class has only one method, we could pass
the function itself. Specialize if the type is known. General
inlining. Common subexpression elimination. Whatnot. Generating
optimal code is a huge time sink. It would be nice if we could rely on
Closure to do all the boring optimizations and only do cool
language-specific optimizations in PureScript.</p>
<h2 id="closure-as-a-bundler-only-simple-optimizations">Closure as a bundler only (simple optimizations)</h2>
<p>In addition to its own <code>goog.module</code>-based module system, Closure
nowadays also handles CommonJS modules and ES6 modules. The PureScript
compiler <code>purs</code> produces CommonJS modules in the <code>output/</code> folder by
default. This is how to call Closure to produce a single JavaScript
file <code>bundle.js</code> with all modules bundled into one:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">closure-compiler</span> <span class="at">--process_common_js_modules</span> <span class="at">--module_resolution</span> NODE <span class="at">--dependency_mode</span> STRICT <span class="at">--entry_point</span> main.js <span class="at">--js</span> main.js <span class="at">--js</span> <span class="st">'output/**.js'</span> <span class="at">--js_output_file</span> bundle.js</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note the <code>--entry_point main.js</code> argument. PureScript does not
actually generate code that invokes any <code>main</code> function. Assuming you
have a module <code>Main</code>, this is a <code>main.js</code> file that actually causes
side effects to happen:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">require</span>(<span class="st">'output/Main'</span>)<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">main</span>()<span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There can be multiple entry points. I think these are just modules
assumed to be called from external code, and Closure will omit
bundling any modules that are not transitively required by any entry
point.</p>
<p>You might want to add <code>--isolation_mode IIFE</code> which wraps the output
in an immediately called function and enables further optimizations.</p>
<p>This seems to work okay. It is not particularly fast (about the same
as browserify). It is also not particularly good at reducing code
size. In fact, in my tests it has been much better to use <code>purs bundle</code> and use Closure with simple optimizations on the resulting
bundle. However, I think <code>purs bundle</code> cannot deal with npm
dependencies. Closure does find modules in <code>node_modules</code>.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-optimizations">Advanced optimizations</h2>
<p>Just adding <code>-O ADVANCED</code> to the above command does not work.</p>
<h3 id="constructors">Constructors</h3>
<p>Advanced optimizations require every function that is used as a
constructor/with the <code>new</code> keyword to be annotated with <code>/** @constructor */</code>. PureScript generates constructors for typeclass
dictionaries (I think) and datatypes.</p>
<p>I hacked the PureScript code generation to add <code>@constructor</code>
annotations to capitalized functions. Note: the constructor annotation
needs to be on the binder, not the function itself. This took me ages
to figure out.</p>

<h3 id="records">Records</h3>
<p>The obvious problem, and what makes Closure advanced compilation so
great/difficult are records. Just briefly: Closure renames record
fields consistently if you use the non-string syntax for construction
and projection. Closure would rename <code>field</code> in this <code>{field: 5}.field</code>, to <code>a</code>, or something. Well, this example would optimize to
just 5, but you get the idea. However, Closure does not rename fields
that introduced with the string syntax <code>{"field": 5}</code> or projected
using the string/array syntax <code>record["field"]</code>. Now, if you mix these
you are in trouble, because the <code>"field"</code> you are trying to project
will likely have been renamed to <code>a</code>. The solution in JavaScript and
ClojureScript is basically: people mostly use the non-string syntax
because it’s shorter anyways, and you just have to be a bit careful to
be consistent when you use strings.</p>
<p>PureScript has an interesting challenge: <code>RowToList</code> and all the
record stuff that builds on it like <code>records</code>, <code>simple-json</code>, and so
forth. I think in theory the set of record labels that will possibly
be projected is computable at compile time and with enough compiler
smarts we could generate specialized getters and setters to enable
consistent non-string label records. In practice, it’s pretty hopeless
right now. I think the way to go would be to always emit record
construction and projection using the string syntax.</p>
<p>Note: the same is not true for datatypes and typeclass
dictionaries. These should use non-string syntax. Their runtime
representation is meant to be hidden from JavaScript anyway, so not
even FFI code should be affected (much).</p>
<p>I thought of another approach. We could have different kinds of
labels, those that get renamed and those that don’t. PureScript
already has string syntax for labels (for labels with names of
keywords and similar parser-related reasons). I suppose one could
hijack those to have basically the same distinction as in Closure,
where plain labels are subject to renaming, and string labels are
guaranteed to be preserved. This is a massive change to the language
though, and almost definitely not worth it now.</p>
<h3 id="other-thoughts">Other thoughts</h3>
<p>One can annotate JavaScript with types that are used by Closure mostly
for “typechecking” or at least linting and, supposedly,
optimizations. While we could annotate at least some simple types, it
is not clear how much would be gained.</p>
<p>The PureScript culture uses fairly little foreign code and it tends to
be well-isolated into a few FFI files. This could make
writing/checking “externs” files a lot nicer than in less disciplined
languages and communities.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Closure with simple optimizations is not much better than other
bundlers/minifiers. If you can, use <code>purs bundle</code> first, then run
Closure on the result.</p>
<p>My codegen hacks to the PureScript compiler made it possible to
compile some very simple experiments (that did no use records) with
Closure’s advanced optimizations to really, really good JavaScript. No
curried functions. All typeclass indirection gone. Pretty much
perfect. It will not work as well for more abstract code than just
printing results of arithmetic expressions, of course.</p>
<p>I don’t think it would be too hard to either change PureScript itself,
or write an alternative backend, to produce Closure-compatible code. I
still think the easy way to better performance is through using
Closure, rather than reimplementing optimizations in the PureScript
compiler.</p>
